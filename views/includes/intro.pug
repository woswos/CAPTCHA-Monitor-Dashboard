							| The Cloudflare CAPTCHA Monitoring project 
							| aims to track how often Cloudflare fronted 
							| websites return CAPTCHAs to Tor clients.
							| The project aims to achieve this by fetching
							| webpages via both Tor and other mainstream
							| web browsers and comparing the results.
							| The tests are repeated periodically to find
							| the patterns over time. 
							br
							br
							| Collected metadata,
							| metrics, and results are analyzed and
							| displayed here to understand how Cloudflare
							| manipulates internet traffic and affects
							| people's access to the internet.
							| Please visit the 
							| 
							a(href='https://gitlab.torproject.org/woswos/CAPTCHA-Monitor/-/wikis/home') project website
